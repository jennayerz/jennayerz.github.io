    <h3>Summary: Latitude vs 4 Factors</h3>

    <p>For this project, we analyzed several different factors that could 
       affect weather based on latitude as you travel closer to the equator. 
       We used the OpenWeatherMap API to prove that it gets hotter as you 
       approach the equator. To achieve this, we randomly selected 500 unique 
       cities based on latitude and longitude.</p>
    <p>Matplotlib was used to visualize the dataset that we retrieved and 
       assembled. Four factors that we considered were temperature, cloudiness, 
       wind speed, and humidity.</p>
    <p>This site provides the source data and visualizations created as part 
       of the analysis, as well as explanations and descriptions of any trends and 
       correlations witnessed.</p>
